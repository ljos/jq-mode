* What is it?
  =jq-mode= is an emacs major mode for editing [[https://github.com/stedolan/jq][jq]]-scripts.

* Getting started
  [[https://melpa.org/#/jq-mode][file:https://melpa.org/packages/jq-mode-badge.svg]] [[https://stable.melpa.org/#/jq-mode][file:https://stable.melpa.org/packages/jq-mode-badge.svg]]
  - Download jq-mode.el and put it in a directory somewhere.
  - Add the following to your .emacs file

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/jq-mode-dir")
  (autoload 'jq-mode "jq-mode.el"
      "Major mode for editing jq files" t)
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.jq$" . jq-mode))
  #+END_SRC

  Now jq-mode will load whenever you visit a file whose name ends
  with .jq. Alternatively, run =M-x jq-mode= in an existing
  buffer containing jq commands.

* Interactive mode
  =jq-mode= can also be used interactively in a JSON buffer. If you
  add the following to your .emacs file

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (with-eval-after-load "json-mode"
      (define-key json-mode-map (kbd "C-c C-j") #'jq-interactively))
  #+END_SRC

  or you can call =M-x jq-interactivly=. =jq-interactively= runs the
  expression that is written in the minibuffer iteratively over the
  JSON buffer. Press =C-g= to abort, =C-j= for newline, =RET= commits
  any changes.

* Org babel

  =jq-mode= provides =ob-jq= for working with literate programming in
  Org mode.

  Add =jq= under =org-babel-load-languages= in your .emacs file
  
  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-do-load-languages 'org-babel-load-languages
                               '((jq . t)))
  #+END_SRC

** jq specific header arguments

=ob-jq= provides some additional header arguments:

- =:compact= :: Add =-c= to =jq= arguments list suppressing pretty printing

* Bugs and Enhancements
  If you have a problem or would like to see it get better in a
  specific way, feel free to drop an issue in [[https://github.com/ljos/jq-mode/issues][the issue tracker]].
  Enjoy!
