* What is it?
  `jq-mode` is an emacs major mode for editing [[https://github.com/stedolan/jq][jq]]-scripts.

* Getting started
  - Download jq-mode.el and put it in a directory somewhere.
  - Add the following to your .emacs file

  #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/jq-mode-dir")
  (autoload 'sparql-mode "jq-mode.el"
      "Major mode for editing jq files" t)
  (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.jq$" . jq-mode))
  #+END_SRC

  Now jq-mode will load whenever you visit a file whose name ends
  with .jq. Alternatively, run =M-x jq-mode= in an existing
  buffer containing jq commands.

* Bugs and Enhancements
  If you have a problem or would like to see it get better in a
  specific way, feel free to drop an issue in [[https://github.com/ljos/jq-mode/issues][the issue tracker]].
  Enjoy!
